## IR Signal Capture and Replay with Arduino

**Overview:**
This Arduino code enables you to capture, analyze, and replay infrared (IR) signals using an Arduino board and the IRremote library. It's a versatile project that simplifies working with IR signals, making it useful for tasks such as replicating remote control commands or debugging IR communication.

### Features

- **IR Signal Capture**: Captures incoming IR signals.
- **IR Signal Replay**: Replays captured IR signals.
- **Detailed Debugging**: Provides comprehensive information about received IR signals for debugging.

### Code Explanation

1. **Library Inclusion**: The code begins by including the [IRremote](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote) library, which provides essential functions and classes for working with IR signals. 

2. **Pin Definitions**: Constants are defined for the pins used for the IR receiver and IR transmitter. You can easily customize these pins to match your hardware setup.

3. **Initialize IR Receiver and Transmitter Objects**: Instances of the `IRrecv` and `IRsend` classes from the IRremote library are created, specifying the pins for the IR receiver and transmitter.

4. **Setup Function**: In the `setup()` function, serial communication is initialized at a baud rate of 115200 for debugging purposes. The IR receiver is enabled to start receiving IR signals.

5. **Dump Function**: The `dump()` function prints detailed information about received IR signals, including the protocol type, raw signal data (in ticks and microseconds), signal data as C arrays, and Pronto format data (if available).

6. **Loop Function**: The `loop()` function is the main part of the program, running repeatedly. When an IR signal is received using `irrecv.decode()`:

   - The code retransmits the received IR signal as raw data with a modulation frequency of 38 kHz using `irsend.sendRaw()`. This effectively repeats the received signal.
   - The `dump()` function is called to print detailed information about the received IR signal.
   - The IR receiver is resumed with `irrecv.resume()` to prepare for receiving the next IR signal.

### Customization

You can easily customize the code by adjusting the pin definitions or modifying the behavior in the `dump()` function to suit your project requirements.

### Raw Buffer Length

The code defines a constant `RAW_BUFFER_LENGTH` with a value of 750, specifying the maximum length of the RAW buffer for storing IR signal data.

### Conclusion

This code offers a clean and comprehensive solution for working with IR signals using an Arduino. It captures and replays IR signals while providing detailed insights for debugging and analysis, making it valuable for projects involving IR communication or remote control emulation.
